<p>I am now a Research Assistant at <a href="http://www.bnu.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj/index.html">Beijing Normal University, China</a>. And I studied here for long years through my bachelor and master degrees.</p>

<li><dl>
<dt><code>MATLAB</code></dt>
<dd>I used <code>MATLAB</code> very often when I was in my Master Degree project to analyze behavioral data from psychological field. I can fluently do programming design, data manipulation and statistical model fitting jobs using <code>MATLAB</code>.
</dd>

<li><dl>
<dt><code>R</code></dt>
<dd>I also used <code>R</code> very often because of its highly power in statistical processing with its package extension system and report generation by <code>Rmarkdown</code> extension. I can now fluently do programming design, data manipulation, statistical model fitting (esp. <em>structural equation model</em>), and report generation jobs with <code>R</code>. Besides, I can sort of use <code>rvest</code> package to do some web-scraping work.

<dt>Regression</dt>
<dd><em>Regression</em> is the basic of statistical modeling. I studied statistics when I was in my undergraduate ages, and, therefore, I have mastered some mathemathetics basics for statistics. I thought of regression as the most fundamental and tried my best to understand all of its details (his website is partly about it). Now I understood basics of <em>multiple linear regression</em> and <em>mixed-effect linear regression</em>. I will study more on this in the near future.

<dt>Structural Equation Model</dt>
<dd><em>Structural Equation Model</em> (aka <em>latent variable analysis</em>) is an expansion of multiple linear regression, which is a powerful tool to detect interesting pattern among multiple variables. I can apply this model using <code>R</code> with <a href="http://lavaan.ugent.be/"><code>lavaan</code></a> package, which was also used when I was writing my master degree thesis.
