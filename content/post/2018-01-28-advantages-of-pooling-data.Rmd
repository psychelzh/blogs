# Introduction

In real study, we would readily collect categorical data, e.g., gender, school grade, etc. Here we focus on categorical data with two categories (or levels) only (also called **binary variable**), because those with more than two categories can be easily cracked likewise with one or more dummy variables. 

Here we use a [dataset](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat501/files/data/birthsmokers.txt) collecting birth weight (**Wgt**, $y$) of 32 babies and information of smoking (**Smoking**, $x_1$) and length of gestation (**Gest**, $x_2$) of mothers. $x_1$ is a binary variable, whose value is either "yes" or "no", while other variables are quantitative variables.

Here we plot two figures for this dataset:

```{r load data and visualization, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=c("Matrix plot of all variables", "Linear trend of different groups")}
library(tidyverse)
birthsmoke <- read.table("https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat501/files/data/birthsmokers.txt", header = TRUE)
plot(birthsmoke)
ggplot(birthsmoke, aes(Gest, Wgt, color = Smoke)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()
```
