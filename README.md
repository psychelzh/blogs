# Blogs

Here is the source codes (`blogdown` files) for my personal static blogging website.

## Acknowledge

This site is created by the great tool [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) created by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/). Based on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a useful site-developing tool, **blogdown** makes blogging exetremely easy for me, a web noob without any former web developing experiences. The Hugo-theme [XMin](https://xmin.yihui.name/) is originally developed by **Yihui Xie**, too.
